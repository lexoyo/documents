- load balancing:
  - current: nothing
  - quick fix: rsync + monitoring emails + manual DNS switch
  - MX relay
  - investigate: rsync + haproxy (extra bandwidth costs? extra lag? 98+1+1 DNS round robin?)
  - investigate: use iframes for traffic routing somehow?
- architecture:
  - docker
  - systemd with @.service templates
  - haproxy
  - setup.sh, adduser.sh
- eventually, look at VOLUMES from Dockerfile to generate the blueprint and the list of which host paths to mount
