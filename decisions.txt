# Post-campaign

On Monday, 10 am, we have a virtual coffee to discuss who will host who.

# Definition of IndieHosters

A migration network for hosting providers.

# Migration format

A runme file, included with the user's data, which either runs a docker image or does vagrant up or whatever.

# Products

Open source projects can package their product by defining the runme file for the migration of an instance of that software. There is a feature spec for each product, for instance for the WordPress product, it may say it includes the domain name and a TLS cert, offers WordPress 4.0.1 in the domain root, with these and these plugins, plus Piwik-based stats on https://domain.com/stats, and sends a backup to two git servers each hour.

# Infrastructure

The packaged product which is bootstrapped from the runme file defines the reference implementation for that product. There may be alternative implementations which make other design choices but offer the same user-facing functionality. There is also the SNI offloader which hosters may use to run individual web domains as haproxy backends, and thus save on hardware (sharing one IPv4 address among multiple domain names). Some applications need to be run on one IPv4 address per domain, so these will generally be more expensive to host.

# Infrastructure design

- load balancing:
  - current: nothing
  - quick fix: rsync + monitoring emails + manual DNS switch
  - MX relay
  - investigate: rsync + haproxy (extra bandwidth costs? extra lag? 98+1+1 DNS round robin?)
  - investigate: use iframes for traffic routing somehow?
- architecture, based on systemd, docker, haproxy, and some bash scripts:
  - docker
  - systemd with @.service templates
  - haproxy
  - scripts/setup.sh, scripts/activate-user.sh
- eventually, look at VOLUMES from Dockerfile to generate the blueprint and the list of which host paths to mount

# Website
  - blue screen from Cami
  - static blog with jekyll

# Product
  - step 1: money + email address
  - super-simple-to-use update by email product:
    - do you have a pseudonym?
    - choose domain name from these 5 options
    - send us a photo and short text
    - links to your silo accounts
  - other edit options from there on:
    - via email/chat/person/voice/... (photo/text update)
    - via ... (html)
    - via ... (blog post)
    - the git repo we should be polling with our cron jobs

# Launch phases
  - hackernews phase -> make hackernews readers enthusiastic, build following
  - crowd-funding phase -> appeal to people who gave money to diaspora, mailpile, sandstorm, ind.ie, etc.
  - live phase -> compete with "normal" hosting providers on share/connect/store, and start conquering niche markets (biggest first)

# Five focus areas:
- technical
  - infrastructure
  - applications
- communication
  - website
  - talking to relevant people
  - crowdfunding

# Initial income

- grants (incl. initial 6000 EUR)
- redundancy-less wordpress for real customers (just 10 new customers per month)
- crowdfunding: basic MVP or redundancy-less Wordpress + T-shirt + sticker
- bountysource (only claimable if you first become an IndieHoster):
  - 100 EUR / LAMP product
  - 1000 EUR any other stack

# Join the IndieWeb campaign
* 50 EUR/year for either WordPress-based or Known-based product
* We aim to get 400x50=20,000 EUR, and set all these new customers up in one batch, in January. That way some money will be left over for R&D.


# SSL

* the official line is to use 9 USD certs from namecheap, so as not to break the startssl T&C. If you own the domain name, then registering at startssl is allowed.
