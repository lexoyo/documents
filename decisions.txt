- load balancing:
  - current: nothing
  - quick fix: rsync + monitoring emails + manual DNS switch
  - MX relay
  - investigate: rsync + haproxy (extra bandwidth costs? extra lag? 98+1+1 DNS round robin?)
  - investigate: use iframes for traffic routing somehow?
- architecture, based on systemd, docker, haproxy, and some bash scripts:
  - docker
  - systemd with @.service templates
  - haproxy
  - scripts/setup.sh, scripts/activate-user.sh
- eventually, look at VOLUMES from Dockerfile to generate the blueprint and the list of which host paths to mount

- website:
  - blue screen from Cami
  - static blog with jekyll

- product:
  - step 1: money + email address
  - super-simple-to-use update by email product:
    - do you have a pseudonym?
    - choose domain name from these 5 options
    - send us a photo and short text
    - links to your silo accounts
  - other edit options from there on:
    - via email/chat/person/voice/... (photo/text update)
    - via ... (html)
    - via ... (blog post)
    - the git repo we should be polling with our cron jobs

- launch phases:
  - hackernews phase -> make hackernews readers enthusiastic, build following
  - crowd-funding phase -> appeal to people who gave money to diaspora, mailpile, sandstorm, ind.ie, etc.
  - live phase -> compete with "normal" hosting providers on share/connect/store, and start conquering niche markets (biggest first)

# five focus areas:
- technical
  - infrastructure
  - applications
- communication
  - website
  - talking to relevant people
  - crowdfunding

# Initial income

- grants (incl. initial 6000 EUR)
- redundancy-less wordpress for real customers (just 10 new customers per month)
- crowdfunding: basic MVP or redundancy-less Wordpress + T-shirt + sticker
- bountysource (only claimable if you first become an IndieHoster):
  - 100 EUR / LAMP product
  - 1000 EUR any other stack

# Join the IndieWeb campaign
* 50 EUR/year for either WordPress-based or Known-based product
* We aim to get 400x50=20,000 EUR, and set all these new customers up in one batch, in January. That way some money will be left over for R&D.


# SSL

* the official line is to use 9 USD certs from namecheap, so as not to break the startssl T&C. If you own the domain name, then registering at startssl is allowed.
