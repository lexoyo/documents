# We proudly present: The IndieHosters Freedom Bundles

For most proprietary, closed and centralised services that people nowadays use
on the web there exists at least one
[free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition)
alternative. As you might know, we, as IndieHosters, host and offer several of
those alternatives to our users. We want to give you back the control over your
data and free you from locked-in situations, where you cannot communicate with
users on different services and cannot get your data back under your control.

Besides the individual advantages our vision is the
[re-decentralisation](http://redecentralize.org/) of the Internet: an open
network of federated services where users as citizens have the freedom to choose
where to host their data. They might choose to install and run their own server,
pay a [hoster like us](https://indiehosters.net/page/home) or [similar
like-minded organisations and companies](https://github.com/indiehosters/nice-hosting-providers) that
they trust, or even use one of the popular and large-scale cloud platforms. Free
software web applications and open protocols are the cornerstone of this
infrastracture, as only those guarantee that users can connect between different
services and move the data to any other service if they find a solution that
fits them better.

We feel that more and more people become aware of the problems around central data
storage and the related accumulation of power, but we also notice that many
still do not know that alternatives exist or if they are good enough for their
daily work and communication. For this reason we decided to start an offer that
we call "[Freedom Bundles](https://indiehosters.net/shop/category/bundle-16)".
The bundles are our alternative to cloud services like Gmail and Outlook,
and provide everything you need in your daily communication and collaboration,
whether at home or for work. As we want to show you some of the cool features of
our bundles and the free software applications that are part of them, we will
at the same time start a series of blog posts about our new offer. In one post
per week we will, for example, publish screencasts and howtos in which we
demonstrate the most useful features of the application, or do an interview with
one of the developers to learn more about the history and vision of the app.
Last but not least we will also give the word to you, our users, to learn more
about your reasons to use free software instead of closed and locked services.

We will start with our blog post campaign on the 1st of March with a more
detailed descriptions of the bundles. In the beginning the focus will be on
ownCloud as the cornerstone of our new offer. We are already very excited to
learn about the app from a different angle, and invite you all to join us on
our journey through the Internet of the future. Stay tuned!
