# IndieHosters' Application of the Month

For most proprietary, closed and centralised services that people use nowadays
on the web, there exists at least one free software alternative. As you might
know, we, as IndieHosters, host and offer several of those alternatives to our
users. We want to give you back the control over your data and free you from
locked-in situations, where you cannot communicate with users on different
services and cannot get your data back under your control.

Besides the individual advantages our vision is the re-decentralisation of the
Internet: an open network of federated services where users as citizens have the
freedom to choose where to host their data. They might choose to install and run
their own server, pay a hoster like us or similar like-minded organisations and
companies that they trust, or even use one of the popular and large-scale cloud
platforms. Free software web applications and open protocols are the cornerstone
of this infrastracture, as only those guarantee that users can connect between
different services and move the data to any other service if they find a
solution that fits them better.

We feel that more and more people become aware of the problems around central data
storage and the related accumulation of power, but we also notice that many
still do not know that alternatives exist. For this reason we decided to start
a series of blog posts that we call "Application of the Month". Each month, we
will present a free software web application from the IndieHosters offer. We
will highlight some of its features and how it contributes to the
re-decentralisation of the Inernet. In one post per week we will, for example,
publish screencasts and howtos in which we demonstrate the coolest and most
useful features of the application, or do an interview with one of the
developers to learn more about the history and vision of the app. Last but not
least we will also give the word to you, our users, to learn more about your
reasons to use free software instead of closed and locked services.

The first "Application of the Month" will be ownCloud and we will start our posts
beginning of March. We are already very excited to learn about the apps that we
offer from a different angle, and invite you all to join us on our journey
through the Internet of the future. Stay tuned!
