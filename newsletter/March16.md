NewsLetter March 2016

Dear fellow IndieHosted,

# News:

## Refocus:

We decided to refocus our offer around cloud+email. We redesigned our landing page, and are starting a serie of blog post.
You can start to read the [introduction here](https://blog.indie.host/2016/we-proudly-present-the-indiehosters-freedom-bundles-1).

[Check our new Site!](https://indiehosters.net/page/home)

## KanBanBoard and Chat

We are also offering great applications.
One is a Kanboard - [WeKan](https://wekan.io/) it is an alternative to Trello.
The other one is a great chat application: [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/). We use it every days, as an alternative to slack.

For these 2 projects, we are listed on their website as an official hosted solution \o/ (notice the great button).

## Community

We are working on your community!
We have now more places than ever to interact!

If you:
 - want to get in touch: contact@indie.host
 - need urgent support about the Infrastructure: support@indie.host
 - want support about your application: https://forum.indie.host
 - want to have a chat: https://chat.indie.host

We hope this way, we'll manage to create a friendly community around freedom in the cloud!

## Board

As you know, we are not a Startup.
But, we have to admit that we are maybe not the best business man out there.
We guess that among you some people are knowlegeable on how we could get IndieHosters to the next step.

We are looking for a group of 5 people that could give us 1 hour of their precious time per month.
We could have a monthly meeting with them to help us take the best decisions.

We believe in IndieHosters, we want to have an Impact, the greated possible.
So if you think you are the one, or know somebody that would be interested, please get in touch with us!
