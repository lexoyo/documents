NewsLetter December 15

Dear all,

The December issue:

It's been a year already! I started on a RaspberryPi some years ago to host friends website, and now it's been a year I'm making hosting my main profesionnal activity.
I started with Michiel, he stopped in June, and in December, [Peter Joined](https://www.peterbouda.eu/2015/i-am-an-indiehoster-now) \o/.

Let's make a little summary of this year in numbers:

 - [15 web apps](https://indiehosters.net/shop/category/applications-12)
 - 74 users and organisations freed
 - 286 containers running
 - 321 subribers to this NewsLetter
 - 317 followers on twitter
 - 245 facebook likes
 - 960 hours worked
 - [Money spent](https://github.com/indiehosters/documents/blob/master/finance_year_1): spent: 1700€
 - [Money received](https://github.com/indiehosters/documents/blob/master/finance_year_1): 4096€ 
 - [1,378 contributions](https://github.com/pierreozoux) to Free and Open Source projects

As you can see, it is not yet profitable. With Peter, we have a lot of idea for IndieHosters year 2.
We think about making a crowdfunding in March.
For that matter, we'd need your input to understand better what you are looking for.
