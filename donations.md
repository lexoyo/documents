# How to give us money :)

* Neither the Cyber Foundation nor any of the branches will accept venture capital, since there is exit strategy, and no build-up of value
  other than the personal relationship an IndieHoster builds up with their own customers.
* Some branches may be interested in business loans, in the same way a hairdresser may take a business loan which they aim to pay back after
  growing their client base.
* Although we will implement some quality control to decide which branches will appear on the main site as
  recommended ("certified") branches, anybody can start an "unofficial" IndieHosters branch. We will list inofficial branches in a way that
  makes it clear they are not (yet) certified. As the aim of the network is to grow as much as possible in number of users, numbers of products
  offered, but also number of franchise branches in stable operation, we welcome everybody who wants to participate as an unofficial branch,
  or who wants to join the "certified" list (which will be more or less a self-ordering list, based on for instance PKIs, peer review, and peer
  evaluation).
* We are taking donations to help the initial build-up of the necessary structures, knowledge and documentation. We will not be developing a
  software product. We will only be hosting pre-existing software products, following standard best practices and already existing tutorials.
* The best way for outsiders to invest in IndieHosters.net is to become a customer! We will probably offer a 10 EUR/month or 100 EUR/year plan,
  and the people who pay one year ahead, together, are helping their personal IndieHoster with some bootstrap credit during those (first)
  twelve months.
* If you really, really like IndieHosters and want to sponsor us even more, you could for instance give a few three-month trials to people with
  whom you celebrate Christmas, thus at the same time helping us bootstrap as well as grow our customer base if these people stay on after the
  trial.
* Maybe we could do something like a pay-one-give-one scheme, where someone who cannot afford their own server can receive one for free.
* We also discussed the possibility of a pay-it-forward scheme, where you sponsor a user, who can then choose to sponsor another user as a way
  of paying forward the favor they received from you.
* We applied for a grant from NLNet, and will be applying for others
* We are considering doing a crowdfunding campaign via IndieGoGo or similar
