# LibrePaaS

Once the modulisation of LibrePaaS is over, it just becomes a place for:
 - utilities to manage the infra
 - unit-files for applications and system

Here is the folder organisation
/ (ssd)
/data (spinning disks/RAID1)
 ./domains
 ./trash
 ./
/system
 ./haproxy
 ./backup
 ./git-puller
/indiehosters
 ./unit-files
 ./utils

# Application

Use the same as YUNOHOST.
