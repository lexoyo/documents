Pierre Ozoux - IndieHoster - Warrant Canary

Existing and proposed laws, especially as relate to the US Patriot Act, etc., provide
for secret warrants, searches and seizures of data.

Some such laws provide for criminal penalties for revealing the warrant, search or seizure, disallowing the disclosure of events that would materially affect the users of a service
such as my hosting service.

I will in fact comply with such warrants and their provisions for secrecy.

I will also make available, monthly, a "warrant canary" in the form of a cryptographically signed message containing the following:

- a declaration that, up to that point, no warrants have been served, nor have any searches or seizures taken place

- a cut and paste headline from a major news source, establishing date

Special note should be taken if these messages ever cease being updated, or are removed from this page.

Notes:

This scheme is not infallible.  Although signing the declaration makes it impossible for a third party to produce arbitrary declarations, it does not prevent them from using force to coerce me to produce false declarations.
The news clip in the signed message serves to demonstrate that that update could not have been created prior to that date.  It shows that a series of these updates were not created in advance and posted on this page.

As a comment on that, I have one server in germany, and one VM hosted in Paris by an american company.
I backuo data on VM hosted by an american provider, but I use encrypt backups before sending them.
My service is not (yet) oriented for strong privacy/intamacy.
As my disks are not (yet) encrypted, I have good reasons to think that secret services (german or american) can easily copy our data. And I will not notice it.

As a general advice, do not put data online that you think are important to keep your privacy/intimacy.
Or encrypt them before sending!
