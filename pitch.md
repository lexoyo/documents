# 1: The Problem

* Hosted software is important infrastructure for humanity, but it is controlled too much by strong multinationals
* A lot of grassroots projects have developed free software which offers similar functionality, and which you can run on your own server.
* However, in practice very few people choose to use such host-it-yourself software, because it is too much (complicated) work.
* Some hosting providers offer "one-click install" for some software products, but for a user who does not necessarily know what the difference between a caching name server and an authoritative name server is, the sign-up process is still orders of magnitude more complicated than signing up for Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, or Gmail.
* There are several "meta-software" projects which make it easier to manage your own server, but even with them, you need to get a (virtual) server somewhere first, and if you have never used ssh or ftp before, it remains a very complicated task.
* There are several physical "plugserver" and "mediaserver" products, but in practice, using your house as a datacenter location is in itself an unattractive option for all but a small niche of the hosted software market.

# 2: The Plan

* We are setting up a new franchise brand for personal hosting. "IndieHosters: We host your own server."
* We will use a containerized architecture to make sure semi-trusted applications are sandboxed well, and we can easily scale the number of different products we want to offer.
* We will publish all our infrastructure documents from day one, and users will own all the data related to their server, making it easy for users to migrate from one franchise branch to another, or to an unrelated hosting provider altogether.
* Each franchise branch will consist of one operator and his or her customers, and will run as an autonomous cell. Users are free to migrate from one branch to another at any time, easily, and without interrupting the service.
* The franchise as a whole will be a non-profit Cyber Foundation, existing only as a moneyless cooperation between the independent hosters who form IndieHosters.net.

# 3: The Product

* We will offer many one-click install applications; not only the usual WordPress and ownCloud, but also many unproven niche applications for which currently nobody is offering one-click hosting.
* Sign-up will be truly one-click, including the domain name registration, DNS setup, and TLS certificate installation.
* Publish: share content on your own website, using an app like Idno, Wordpress, Ghost, etcetera.
* Store: keep your data and files in one place which you control, using an app like ownCloud, Cozy, Mediagoblin, etcetera.
* Communicate: use your own server for email, chat, telephony, video calls, etcetera.
* Niche: Explore exciting decentralized technology like MozillaCloud, Gitlab, remoteStorage, etcetera.
