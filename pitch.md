# 1: The Problem

* Hosting software is important infrastructure for humanity, but it is controlled too much by strong multinationals
* A lot of grassroots projects have developed free software which offers similar functionality, and which you can run on your own server.
* However, in practice very few people choose to use such host-it-yourself software, because it is too much (complicated) work.
* There are several "meta-software" projects which make it easier to manage your own server, but even with them, it remains a complicated task.
* Some hosting providers offer "one-click install" for some software products, but for a user who does not necessarily know what the difference
    between a caching name server and an authoritative name server is, the sign-up process is still orders of magnitude more complicated than
    signing up for Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, or Gmail.

# 2: The Plan

* We are setting up a new franchise brand for personal hosting. "IndieHosters: We host your own server."
* We will use a containerized architecture to make sure semi-trusted applications are sandboxed well, and we can easily scale the number of
  different products we want to offer.
* We will publish all our infrastructure documents from day one, and users will own all the data related to their server, making it easy for
  users to migrate from one franchise branch to another, or to an unrelated hosting provider altogether.
* Each franchise branch will consist of one operator and his or her customers, and will run as an independent and autonomous cell.

# 3: The Product

* We will offer many one-click install applications; not only the usual WordPress and ownCloud, but also many unproven niche applications for
  which currently nobody is offering one-click hosting.
* Sign-up will be truly one-click, including the domain name registration, DNS setup, and TLS certificate installation.
* Publish: share content on your own website, using an app like Idno, Wordpress, Ghost, etcetera.
* Store: keep your data and files in one place which you control, using an app like ownCloud, Cozy, Mediagoblin, etcetera.
* Communicate: use your own server for email, chat, voice, video calls, etcetera.
* Niche: Explore exciting decentralized technology like MozillaCloud, Gitlab, remoteStorage, etcetera.
