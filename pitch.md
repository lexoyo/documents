Hi, I'm Pierre ... and I'm Michiel ... and we're setting up a personal hosting provider that is different
from any existing hosting providers: IndieHosters.

Just like a normal shared hosting provider, we will host your personal website and your email for you,
and you can also get online storage space. But there are two fundamental differences:

- Hosting for Freedom -

There are a lot of free software projects that offer applications which you can "run on your own server".
But when you try to do this, you usually have to set up a database, paste the password into a configuration file,
and FTP that to a directory. Even with the best install instructions on the project wiki, signing up for Tumblr
or Facebook is much much easier than setting up your own server.

And we will seek out the applications to support all decentralized protocols you can imagine. Our servers run all
applications as Docker containers, so if you know of an application that we should add, you can simply package it
for Docker, and send us a pull request!

- Not for profit -

IndieHosters is not a startup. Startups get seed funding so they can fulfill their exit strategy. Each time this happens,
a part of the web is lost. IndieHosters is more a "stay up". Each IndieHoster operates as an independent unit,
a bit like the autonomous "cells" that often make up underground organizations. If you are unlucky and your
IndieHoster disappears, or does not meet your expectations, then you have a big 'migrate' button in your account,
so you can migrate to any other IndieHoster in the network whenever you want, or become an IndieHoster yourself!

Whenever an IndieHoster retires or goes out of business, they pick 3 or 4 successors and migrate all users to them.

Any system administrator can read our documentation and set up an IndieHosters server. Once you're up and running
and ready to take on paying customers, we'll promote you to a Certified IndieHosters Cell, after which you can start
receiving signups from new customers. You don't need to spend time setting up your own branding and marketing -
it's like opening your own shop that's part of a brand franchise. Since we run as small one-person businesses,
but all share our knowledge in one public knowledge base, we can offer a very personal service, yet have very small
overhead and upfront costs, and be very efficient.

- We need your help! -

This revolutionary project has the potential to change the way we use the internet forever: we can stop the current
trend where ever more people depend on ever fewer mass-scale hosting providers (think Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple,
Microsoft), and open up "corner shops" that offer personal service and free software. It's the responsible choice for
everybody who wants to publish blog posts, photos, upload music, video, use email, jabber and videochat in a
decentralized way, and store their data on their own personal data store. Own your identity. Own your data.

IndieHosters is about IndieWeb, Federated Web, Decentralization, Redecentralization, independence, and freedom
as an active participant on the internet. You can support us by joining our presale. Your donation enables us to make
the IndieHosters network reach the critical size that makes it viable as a full-time vocation for several independent hosters.
Once we achieve that, it will be impossible to switch off the network, and the freedom to have your own personal server will
for always be available to every internet citizen.

# Alternative version:

Bloggers set you free
* bloggers are awesome
* be a blogger
* but be free, be independent
* join the indieweb
* easiest way:
  * newcomers: get your own website
  * existing bloggers: let us indiewebify you
* product:
  * your own .com, or 1 year renewal of an existing one
  * all the blogging tools you will ever need
  * choose between Indie-Wordpress or Known
  * automatically posts to Twitter and Facebook each time you publish something
  * Secured with https
  * email forwarded to your existing mailbox
* migration-oriented organization:
  * you can switch, switch back, switch to yourself, switch back, import, export, as often as you want.
  * each IndieHoster is fully independent, both technically and financially
* And one more thing... also includes ownCloud. so sign up now.

# Fourth version:

* multiply the IndieWeb by 3 orders of magnitude, from 400 to 400,000 users
-> unlike yet EcoBytes-like project, that's a dream we can get people to root for
-> increase the size of the indieweb by 50%
-> so that would call for cut-throat pricing: 200 x 25 EUR for 3 months (incl. DNR) = 5000 EUR goal.
-> and this is only the beginning: xmpp hosting, webrtc, cloud for Firefox OS, quantified self - almost any internet technology, even p2p ones, requires servers. we aim to decentralize the /organizational/ architecture of the internet, not just for one application. not even just for one protocol. migration-oriented hosting is the only viable future for us. let services be owned by users, not by corporations.
-> as connectivity becomes more ubiquitous, devices are now service endpoints, and servers become more important (e.g. huge Apple data centers for iTunes and iCloud).

# idea for perks:

* 10 EUR: stickers
* 30 EUR: stickers + T-shirt
* 100 EUR: get your own website. includes stickers + T-shirt.
* 100 EUR: indiewebify your existing website. includes stickers + T-shirt.
* 500 EUR: supporter
* 1000 EUR: sponsor

# idea for campaign:

* 30 days, 21 Nov - 21 Dec
* Flexible goal: 10,000 EUR

# Longer version:
## 1: The Problem

* Hosted applications (e.g. google docs, pocket) became important for our life but it is controlled by multinationals.
* People have developed free software which offers similar functionality, and which you can run on your own server
* However, in practice very few people choose to use such host-it-yourself software, because it is too complicated.
* Some hosting providers offer "one-click install" for some software, but for a user who does not necessarily know what is a server, the sign-up process is still orders of magnitude more complicated than signing up for Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, or Gmail.
* There are several "meta-software" projects which make it easier to manage your own server, but even with them, you need to get a server somewhere first, and if you have never used ssh nor ftp before, it remains a very complicated task.
* There are several physical "plugserver" and "mediaserver" products, but in practice, using your house as a datacenter location is in itself an unattractive option for all but a small niche of the hosted software market.

## 2: The Plan

* We host your own server
* We are setting up a new franchise brand for personal hosting. "IndieHosters: Hosting for freedom, not for profit!"
* We publish all our documents from day one
* Users will own all the data related to their server, making it easy for users to migrate from one franchise branch to another, or to an unrelated hosting provider altogether.
* Each franchise branch will consist of one operator and his or her customers, and will run as an autonomous cell. Users are free to migrate from one branch to another at any time, easily, and without interrupting the service.
* The franchise as a whole will be a non-profit Cyber Foundation, existing only as a moneyless cooperation between the independent hosters who form IndieHosters network.
* We will use a containerized architecture to make sure semi-trusted applications are sandboxed well, and we can easily scale the number of different products we want to offer.

## 3: The Product

Sign-up will be as easy as possible, including the domain name registration, DNS setup, and TLS certificate installation.

* Publish: share content on your own website, using an app like Idno, Wordpress, Ghost, etcetera.
* Store: keep your data and files in one place which you control, using an app like ownCloud, Cozy, Mediagoblin, etcetera.
* Communicate: use your own server for email, chat, telephony, video calls, etcetera.

We will offer many one-click install applications, including many unproven niche applications for which currently nobody is offering one-click hosting. It'll be a way to explore exciting decentralized technology like MozillaCloud, Gitlab, remoteStorage, etcetera.
